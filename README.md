## Installation Instructions
This repository contains a modified distribution of USE that includes our TPV plug-in. To install the tool, download the repository files as a zip folder and extract them in the desired install directory.

**Note: You must have installed a Java Runtime Environment in order to run USE**.
## Usage Instructions

### 1. Choosing a Class Diagram to Input.
The first input necessary is the class diagram to be analyzed. Click *Select* (TPV Main Window, 1), which opens the following window.

Select the file containing the class diagram that will be analyzed and press *Open*.
### 2. Choosing a TOCL Temporal Property from a File.
The second input necessary is a TOCL temporal property. This can be inputted in different ways. The first is inputting a .tocl file containing a TOCL property (TPV Main Window, 2).
Click *Select*, which opens a window similar to the previous step that asks for a .tocl file.

Select a file containing a temporal property to analyze against and press *Open*.
### 3. Specifying a TOCL Temporal Property.
It is also possible to input a TOCL temporal property by specifying it within the plug-in interface (TPV Main Window, 3). Clicking *Specify* opens the following window:

The first specification method involves typing a TOCL property into the text box labeled *Enter TOCL temporal properties* (Specify TOCL Properties, a).
Alternatively, clicking the *Use Patterns* button (Specify TOCL Properties, d) will bring up the temporal pattern specification window.
This window offers a choice to use different temporal specification patterns as templates for defining TOCL properties. Specified properties can then be saved using the *Save to File* option. (Specify TOCL Properties, e).

To use a specified TOCL property for analysis, click *Apply* (Specify TOCL Properties, c). Any syntax errors generated by specified properties will be displayed in the dialog labeled *Feedback* (Specify TOCL Properties, b).

### 4. Using the Optimization Technique.
Additionally, there is the option to use the *Optimization Technique* included in the plug-in that can shorten the time needed to perform the analysis. Click the checkbox (TPV Main Window, 4) to use it.
### 5. Choosing a Configuration Method.
The next step is configuring the analysis (TPV Main Window, 5). There are two ways to configure the analysis. The first method is entering a new analysis configuration. The second method is using a previously defined configuration stored in a .properties file.
#### i. Creating a New Analysis Configuration
Creating an analysis configuration done by specifying a search-scope and search-depth for the analysis. Search-scope defines the maximum number of objects of each class that can be instantiated during analysis. Search-depth defines the maximum number of transitions considered for analysis.
Once scope and depth have been specified, it is possible to enter an advanced configuration mode. In this advanced mode, an individual analysis configuration can be created for each class and association present in the model.
#### ii. Using a Previously Defined Configuration
To use a previously created configuration, click on the *Configuration method* dropdown (TPV Main Window, 5) and select *Upload .properties file*.
The option *Enter a .properties File* should become visible. Click *Select* and choose the .properties file containing the desired analysis configuration.
### 6. Performing the Analysis.
Finally to perform the analysis and search for a counterexample, press *Validate*. You can also press *Cancel* to close the window.
